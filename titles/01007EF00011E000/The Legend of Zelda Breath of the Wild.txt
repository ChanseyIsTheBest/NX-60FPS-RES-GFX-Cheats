Resolution Hacks By @Hazerou
RRS cheats rely on Dynamic Resolution Function. If you have a mod or cheat that disables it, it will not work
RRS will stop DRS from controlling your Resolution up and down
Don't use old resolution codes previously here with new RRS as it can cause crashes and unxpected resolutions
Docked RRS v2 cheats may crash the gaem if used in handheld mode

FOV Codes by masagrator
Main FOV won't be visible immediately, you must trigger change by f.e. aiming with bow and hiding bow or turn on Current FOV matching your FOV and immediately turn off. It is not advised to have Current FOV constantly turned on.
