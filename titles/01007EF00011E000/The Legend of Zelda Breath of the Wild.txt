Resolution Hacks By @Hazerou

Notes;

1.) FPS will drop straight to 30 and Game Speed will slow down whenever Switch can't handle 60 FPS.

RRS cheats rely on Dynamic Resolution Function. If you have a mod or cheat that disables it, it will not work
RRS will stop DRS from controlling your Resolution up and down
Don't use old resolution codes previously here with new RRS as it can cause crashes and unxpected resolutions
Docked RRS v2 cheats may crash the gaem if used in handheld mode
