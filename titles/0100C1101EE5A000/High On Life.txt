Notes;

1.) [RRS] is Render Resolution Scale and it disables Dynamic Resolution Function. Safe to activate Both H. & D. at the same time.

2.) [Use TAAU] only for use with [AA Mode = TAA] & [AA Medium], else will crash the game if used on other AA Quality. If you wish to switch AA, Deactivate [Use TAAU] and turn ON [Don't Use TAAU] first.

3.) Some GFX Codes has no Function/Effect to the Game
