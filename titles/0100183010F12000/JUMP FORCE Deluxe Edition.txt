For the RRS, I added a conditional code to check if Switch is using Handheld or Docked Mode to the appropriate RRS. You can now activate them at the same time without res producing the wrong value. IE: Activate both [H. RRS 540p] & [D. RRS 720p]

Included in the text file;

[VSync OFF/ON]
[Enable DRS (Handheld 360p<=>720p) (Docked 540p<=>1080p)]
[Default Disable Dynamic Resolution Scaling]
[Handheld RRS 360p up to 1440p]  (Default was 428p)
[Docked RRS 648p up to 4K 2160p]  (Default was 648p)
[Image Sharpening ON/OFF]
[TAAU OFF / Stock / Plus]
[AA OFF / FXAA / TAA]
[Filtering]
[Film Grain ON/OFF]
[Vignette ON/OFF]
[Foggy Scene ON/OFF]
[Motion Blur ON/OFF]
[CHROM AB ON/OFF]
[Lens Flare ON/OFF]
[Use / Don't Use New Film Tone Mapper]
[DOF OFF <=> ON]
[View Distance Scale x0.5 <=> x2]
[Anisotropic Filtering x1 <=> x16]
[Shadow OFF <=> Max]
[Shadow Distance x0.5 <=> x2]
[SSA0 OFF <=> x2]
[Bloom OFF <=> Very High]
[Detail Mode Low <=> High]
[Sky Lighting Quality ON/OFF]
[Adaptive Exposure ON/OFF]
[Foliage ON/OFF (Experimental)]
[Disable / Enable Fully Load Textures ASAP (Experimental)]
[Max Quality Override To Highest ON/OFF]
[Distortion Effects OFF <=> ON]


Notes;

1.) [RRS] is Render Resolution Scale and it disables Dynamic Resolution Function.

2.) [Use TAAU] only for use with [AA Mode = TAA] & [AA Medium], else will crash the game if used on other AA Quality. If you wish to switch AA, Deactivate [Use TAAU] and turn ON [Don't Use TAAU] first.

3.) Some GFX Codes has no Function/Effect to the Game.
