[120 FPS (Recommended for Emu)]
[60 FPS]
[45 FPS]
[Default 30 FPS]
[RRS 50% (360p)]
[RRS 66.66% (480p)]
[RRS 75% (540p)]
[RRS 80% (576p)]
[RRS 85% (612p)]
[RRS 90% (648p)]
[Default RRS 100% (720p)]


Note;
Unfortunately we can't go above 720p using RRS alone.
Just in case a cheat/mod that sets resolution to 1080p has been made, RRS may produce a different res this time. For example RRS 100% should become 1080p instead of 720p
