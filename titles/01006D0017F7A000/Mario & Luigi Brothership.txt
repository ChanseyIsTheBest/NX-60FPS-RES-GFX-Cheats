TAA in this game causes some flickering to the character's shading.

And it's dubbed as SetRes because I don't know what to name it really.
Native 1080p @ RRS 100% looks so much better than
Native 900p @ RRS 120% = 1080p.
Much cleaner and no blurry edges.

How to use;

1.) Only activate one SetRes to your liking.

2.) It will not work right away so you have to (un)dock or use Reverse NX RT => Change Mode.

Just in case the UI/HUD of the game are not fully scaled to the screen, just do step 2 again.

 Changes have been made to all Docked RRS/DRS to reflect with the 1080p native res.

Notes;

1.) [RRS] is Render Resolution Scale and it disables Dynamic Resolution Function. You can now use one for each mode (Handheld & Docked) at the same time.

2.) [Use TAAU] only for use with [AA Mode = TAA] & [AA Medium], else will crash the game if used on other AA Quality. If you wish to switch AA, Deactivate [Use TAAU] and turn ON [Don't Use TAAU] first.

3.) Some GFX Codes has no Function/Effect to the Game.
