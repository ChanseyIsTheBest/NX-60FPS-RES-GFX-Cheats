Crashing issues include:
During Ornstein and Smough's mid-fight cutscene (Ornstein defeated first, idk about the other version)
When Super Smough's AOE lightning attack lands
After entering Ceaseless Discharge's fog gate, turning around to look at the gate again
During Centipede Demon's intro cutscene
