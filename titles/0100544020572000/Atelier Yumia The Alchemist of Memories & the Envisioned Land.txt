Notes;

1.) RRS are for Docked Mode only(use Reverse NX RT) and changes only apply when entering pause menu.

2.) XeSS and AAs can conflict with RRS. Just ON then OFF them for now.

3.) GFX are based on PC Settings toggles in the memory and unfortunately most of them seems to not work. I'll just put these here for experimental. (edited)
