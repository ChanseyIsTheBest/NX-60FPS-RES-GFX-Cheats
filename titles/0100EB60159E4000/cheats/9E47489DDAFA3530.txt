Game uses double buffering. Can't handle 60 FPS = It will drop to 30. Oh, and The speed will slow down when that happens.

What's new?
1.) Added new cheats, some old cheats are left behind but you can find them here;
⁠post-tested-cheats-here⁠

2.) 60 FPS now on v2. Should work properly and untying the speed to framerate.

3.) Motion Blur should also work with Handheld Mode.

Update
1.) Fixed the wrong address for [CHROM AB]. I fell asleep last night in the middle of working on it and It's the thing I forgot to do so I'm sorry for that. (edited)

Know Issues;
1.) Game uses Double Buffering. Which means FPS will drop to 30 and Game speed will slow down if Switch can't handle 60 FPS.

2.) When using 60 FPS, your character's model will vibrate when moving around inside a House/Building.

3.) Since this is a Pokémon Game, bugs from Previous Titles at 60 FPS might also introduce in this game.


Notes;
1.) [RRS] is Render Resolution Scale and it disables Dynamic Resolution Function.
Please use;
Handheld RRS for Handheld Mode.
Docked RRS for Docked Mode.
Don't activate them at the same time!

2.) Same goes to all cheats I posted that have DRS MIN & DRS MAX, you can cofigure the DRS MIN & MAX to your liking. Just grab the codes from [Default No RRS Lock / Re enable DRS (65%<=>100%)] and edit it's values;

04000000 03C5F130 <= DRS MIN #1
04000000 03C5F144 <= DRS MIN #2
04000000 03C5F148 <= DRS MIN #3
04000000 03C5F120 <= DRS MAX #1
04000000 03C5F124 <= DRS MAX #2
04000000 03C5F138 <= DRS MAX #3

Values are [Float32] (1.0 = 100%)

Example;
[Custom DRS (Handheld 360p<=>480p) (Docked 540p<=>720p)]
04000000 03C5F130 3F000000
04000000 03C5F144 3F000000
04000000 03C5F148 3F000000
04000000 03C5F120 3F2AAAAB
04000000 03C5F124 3F2AAAAB
04000000 03C5F138 3F2AAAAB


Though DRS is targeting 30 FPS so they are not fully reliable for use with 60 FPS. (edited)

Same case with SnowRunner  TAA and Lightshaft are not included because they are unstable. And yeah don't set your expectations too high when increasing GFX quality.

How to apply changes properly;
1.) Activate the cheats you want and then go to the in game settings (not the settings from the title screen).

2.) Navigate to the VIDEO settings tab and slide the brightness bar at least 1 step.

3.) Go back and RETURN TO MAIN MENU.

4.) Wait until the title screen appears and close the game.

5.) Launch the game again and profit.

Known Issues;
After making changes and it's saved, Black screen may occur when sliding the brightness bar. Can be resloved by rebooting the game.

Welp I couldn't find the resolutions for Docked mode. So only Handheld mode for now (capped to 720p).
Oh and thanks to @KeatonTheBot for his pchtxt that I used from here ⁠post-mods-here⁠ to search the DRS MAX resolutions for Handheld Mode and also for his DRS MIN for Handheld Mode codes which are included to these cheats!

How to apply changes properly;
1.) Same case with Sonic Colors but this time it's for Handheld Mode only. All you have to do is Dock => Undock and it will apply the effects of the cheats. Or use ⁠reverse-nx-rt Mode: Docked => Mode: Handheld which is much easier to do.


This is my first time posting a cheat based on ASM and I have zero knowledge about it so please don't expect more of these types of cheats coming from me soon
