Notes;

Please use;
Handheld RRS/DRS for Handheld Mode.
Docked RRS/DRS for Docked Mode.
Don't activate them at the same time!

2.) [Use TAAU] only for use with [AA Mode = TAA] & [AA Medium], else will crash the game if used on other AA Quality. If you wish to switch AA, Deactivate [Use TAAU] and turn ON [Don't Use TAAU] first.

3.) Some GFX Codes has no Function/Effect to the Game.
