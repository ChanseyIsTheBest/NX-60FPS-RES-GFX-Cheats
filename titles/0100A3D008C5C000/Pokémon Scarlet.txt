Game is still GPU Heavy even at lowest possible Resolution= 467p

Couldn't find the precise Resolution Code. All I can find is the DRS Levels.
And also Docked Resolutions might not be accurate.

To balance Game Speed at 60 FPS, I used a Game Speed Code from here;
https://gbatemp.net/threads/60-fps-cheats-for-nswitch.592464/post-9994889

1.3.2 60FPS by theboy181/OldManKain 
2.0.1 60FPS by theboy181/OldManKain
3.0.0 60FPS by theboy181/OldManKain

Know Issues;
1.) Game uses Double Buffering. Which means FPS will drop to 30 and Game speed will slow down if Switch can't handle 60 FPS.

2.) When using 60 FPS, your character's model will vibrate when moving around inside a House/Building.

3.) Since this is a Pok√©mon Game, bugs from Previous Titles at 60 FPS might also introduce in this game.


Notes;
1.) [RRS] is Render Resolution Scale and it disables Dynamic Resolution Function.
Please use;
Handheld RRS for Handheld Mode.
Docked RRS for Docked Mode.
Don't activate them at the same time!

2.) Same goes to all cheats I posted that have DRS MIN & DRS MAX, you can cofigure the DRS MIN & MAX to your liking. Just grab the codes from [Default No RRS Lock / Re enable DRS (65%<=>100%)] and edit it's values;

04000000 03C5F130 <= DRS MIN #1
04000000 03C5F144 <= DRS MIN #2
04000000 03C5F148 <= DRS MIN #3
04000000 03C5F120 <= DRS MAX #1
04000000 03C5F124 <= DRS MAX #2
04000000 03C5F138 <= DRS MAX #3

Values are [Float32] (1.0 = 100%)

Example;
[Custom DRS (Handheld 360p<=>480p) (Docked 540p<=>720p)]
04000000 03C5F130 3F000000
04000000 03C5F144 3F000000
04000000 03C5F148 3F000000
04000000 03C5F120 3F2AAAAB
04000000 03C5F124 3F2AAAAB
04000000 03C5F138 3F2AAAAB
