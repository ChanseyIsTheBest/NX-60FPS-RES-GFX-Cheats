How to apply resolution cheat changes properly;
1.) Same case with Sonic Colors but this time it's for Handheld Mode only. All you have to do is Dock => Undock and it will apply the effects of the cheats. Or use ⁠reverse-nx-rt Mode: Docked => Mode: Handheld which is much easier to do.


Cheat code forces The Cutscenes' FPS to 30. It's the only way that I can think of to fix the Cutscenes from Speeding up.
